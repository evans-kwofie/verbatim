## The Architecture of an Argument

Most thesis failures aren't about bad writing. They're about bad structure. A well-constructed argument can survive mediocre prose. A beautifully written argument built on sand cannot survive a defense panel.

### The Foundation: Your Research Question

Every argument begins with a question that is simultaneously specific enough to answer and significant enough to matter. If your research question can be answered with a Google search, it's not a research question. If it requires an entire career to answer, it's not a thesis question.

The sweet spot exists in the tension between these two extremes. Whether you're writing at KNUST, Legon, UCC, or Ashesi — this principle doesn't change.

### The Load-Bearing Walls: Your Methodology

Your methodology isn't a chapter you write to satisfy your supervisor's requirement. It's the structural logic that holds everything else up. Remove it, and the entire edifice collapses.

Ask yourself:
- Does my methodology actually answer my research question?
- Can my chosen approach generate the type of evidence I need?
- Have I justified *why* this method over alternatives?

### The Rooms: Your Chapters

Each chapter should do one thing exceptionally well. It should advance a single, clear argument that contributes to the thesis as a whole. If you can't articulate the purpose of a chapter in one sentence, the chapter doesn't have a purpose yet.

### The Roof: Your Conclusion

Your conclusion isn't a summary. It's a synthesis. It should demonstrate how the individual arguments combine to create something greater than the sum of their parts. Your examiners will check for this.
