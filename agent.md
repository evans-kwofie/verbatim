Project Name: Verbatim – Premium Academic Thesis Consulting Tech Stack: Astro, Tailwind CSS (no component libraries like Shadcn), TypeScript.

Brand Persona: Verbatim is a high-end, elite academic service for Master's and PhD students. It is minimalist, authoritative, and expensive. The aesthetic is "Top-Tier Designer Architecture Portfolio."

Design Requirements:

Typography: Use a sophisticated Serif for headings (e.g., Playfair Display or a custom font) and a clean, high-kerning Sans for body (e.g., Inter or Geist).

Layout: Reject the "feature grid" layout. Use a "monolithic" approach with large sections, intentional negative space, and a black-and-white color palette.

Navigation: Minimalist top-right nav or a hidden "drawer" that feels intentional.

The Ask: > Please provide the file structure and code for the following:

src/layouts/Layout.astro: A base layout using Astro View Transitions. It should include a custom cursor or a very subtle "ink bleed" transition effect.

src/pages/index.astro: A hero section that uses "Typography as Art." The headline should be "The Final Word in Academic Excellence."

src/components/BriefingForm.astro: A bespoke, minimalist multi-step form for clients to submit their thesis details. No generic inputs—use custom styled borders and subtle hover states.

Tailwind Config: Custom spacing scales and a "Paper/Ink" color palette.

Rules: > - DO NOT use Shadcn, Radix, or any "SaaS-in-a-box" UI kits.

Write custom Tailwind classes for everything.

Ensure the code is optimized for Astro's partial hydration.

Focus on "Scannability" and "High-End Minimalist" aesthetic.

A Quick Suggestion on Feature "X"
Since you are a veteran writer, you should add a "Price Calculator" that isn't about word count, but "Cognitive Load." * Level 1: Structural Review (You've written it, I fix the logic).

Level 2: Architecture (I build the outline and research base).

Level 3: Full Articulation (The "Verbatim" experience).

Would you like me to refine the "Briefing Form" logic so you can filter out low-budget tire-kickers before they even message you?
